Responsive Images
==================

An alternative approach to the Filament Group's [responsive images technique](https://github.com/filamentgroup/Responsive-Images).

This approach uses a small amount of server-side code (the example is in PHP but could be anything really) to serve up the correct sized image, rather than relying solely on a js/.htaccess combo.
